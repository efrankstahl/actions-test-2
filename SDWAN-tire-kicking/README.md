demo.py == ruben's original code (maybe with some notes). contains both the preprocessor-SDWAN and the template engine functions

myedits-demo.py == my edits/notes to ruben's original code. 

preprocessor-SDWAN.py == the code from demo.py for JUST the preprocessor goes here.
template_engine == the code from demo.py for JUST the template engine goes here 

robsFlaskapi.py == roberts demo of how he set up an API for the doc engine.  Educational, but doesn't work. 
                    we would need 'document.py' to get it to work. 

robsapicall.py == Robert's demo of sending an actual API request to his flask api 


Sample.zip == a zip of json config files that Ruben sent us to practice with 

/templates == Ruben's doc.jinja2 lives here, which is what we will populate with our proccessed config results 

document_outline.json == Ruben's sample of a filled in template (this is what we'd be sending to the doc engine)
